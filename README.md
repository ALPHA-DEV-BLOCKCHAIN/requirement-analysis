# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository is dedicated to exploring the concept of Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  
It will contain documentation, examples, and resources that explain how requirements are gathered, documented, validated, and managed to ensure successful project outcomes.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, documenting, and validating the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project. It acts as the foundation of the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), bridging the gap between client requirements and technical implementation.  

Through requirement analysis, software teams can ensure the system meets user needs, avoids misunderstandings, and reduces costly rework during development.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis plays a critical role in the SDLC for the following reasons:

1. **Clarity and Alignment**  
   It ensures that all stakeholders (clients, developers, testers, and users) share a common understanding of the system’s goals and expectations.

2. **Reduced Development Costs and Time**  
   Identifying potential issues early helps avoid costly fixes later in the development phase.

3. **Quality Assurance**  
   By clearly defining functional and non-functional requirements, requirement analysis helps in building systems that meet both user needs and performance standards.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

The requirement analysis process includes several structured activities:

- **Requirement Gathering**  
  Collecting information from stakeholders, end-users, and documentation.

- **Requirement Elicitation**  
  Using techniques like interviews, surveys, and brainstorming sessions to uncover explicit and implicit needs.

- **Requirement Documentation**  
  Recording requirements clearly and concisely in formats like Software Requirement Specifications (SRS).

- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**  
  Structuring requirements using models such as use cases, data flow diagrams, or UML diagrams.

- **Requirement Validation**  
  Reviewing and confirming requirements with stakeholders to ensure accuracy, feasibility, and completeness.

## Types of Requirements

Requirements are generally divided into two main categories:

### Functional Requirements

These describe **what the system should do** (features and behaviors).  

**Examples for the Booking Management System:**
- Users can create an account and log in.
- Customers can search for available bookings by date and location.
- Admins can approve or reject booking requests.
- System generates booking confirmations via email.

### Non-Functional Requirements

These define **how the system should perform** (quality attributes).  

**Examples for the Booking Management System:**
- The system should respond to search queries within 2 seconds.
- The application must handle at least 500 concurrent users.
- Data should be encrypted in transit and at rest for security.
- The platform should be accessible on both web and mobile devices.

## Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams visually represent the interactions between users (actors) and the system. They help simplify complex requirements and make them easier to understand.  

**Benefits:**
- Clarify system boundaries.
- Identify user roles and their interactions.
- Provide a visual summary for stakeholders.

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria define the conditions that must be met for a feature to be considered complete and accepted by the client. They serve as a benchmark for testing and validation.  

**Importance:**
- Provide clear expectations for developers and testers.  
- Reduce ambiguity in feature implementation.  
- Ensure features meet user needs before deployment.  

**Example – Checkout Feature (Booking Management System):**

- Users must be able to select a booking and proceed to checkout.  
- System should display the total cost, including taxes and fees.  
- Payment gateway must securely process payments and return confirmation.  
- Users should receive a confirmation email after successful payment.  
- Checkout should be completed in under 5 seconds under normal load.
